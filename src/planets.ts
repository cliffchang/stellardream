    "Thus far, no one theory has been able to make definitive predictions of the
    frequency of planet formation nor of the distribution of planetary sizes and
    orbits."

    "planetary systems may be more common around stars whose spectra show an
    enriched abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium -- also
    called high 'metallicity'"

    "Numerical modeling of the accumulation of planetesimals during molecular
    cloud collapse have produced, on average, four rocky inner planets for models
    similar to the Solar System. The results included two, roughly Earth-sized
    planets and two smaller planets, where their orbital distance ranged between
    that of Mercury (0.4 AU) and Mars (1.5 AU). Hence, some astronomers expect to
    find rocky planets around other stars within that range of orbits."

    "NASA's Kepler Mission is defining the size of an Earth-type planet to be
    those that have between 0.5 and 2.0 times Earth's mass, or those having
    between 0.8 and 1.3 times Earth's radius or diameter. The mission will
    also investigate larger terrestrial planets that have two to ten Earth
    masses, or 1.3 to 2.2 times its radius/diameter. Larger planets, however,
    will be excluded because they may have sufficient gravity to attract a
    massive hydrogen-helium atmosphere like the gas giants. On the other
    extreme, those planets -- like Mars or Mercury -- that have less than
    half the Earth's mass and are located in or near their star's habitable
    zone may lose their initial life-supporting atmosphere because of low
    gravity and/or the lack of plate tectonics needed to recycle
    heat-retaining carbon dioxide gas back into the atmosphere."
